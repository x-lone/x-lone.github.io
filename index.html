                    One of my best childhood memories was getting introduced to a small programming application called Scratch. Building small games and animations and sharing them among friends while seeing them smile and laugh was amazing; ever since I've dreamed of a job involving programming and creating something to share with and bring joy to others.
                    Currently, I'm studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin Stout, concentrating in Cyber Security and Secure Software Development. Additionally, in my free time, I've been working on a few passion projects, all of which I hope to bring to light once I'm closer to their completion.

                    I'm looking for programming internships wherever I can get them; I may only be a second-year, but I'm always open to trying something new and learning.
